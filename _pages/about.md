I am a researcher at Fondazione Bruno Kessler, working on AI-methods for seasonal weather forecasting.
During my PhD in Physics, I focused on the setup and analysis of numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers under the supervision of Albino Perego.

I am part of the CoRe collaboration, a collaborative research effort among scientists from the University of Jena
(Germany), the Federal University of ABC (Brazil), The Pennsylvania State University (USA), Florida Atlantic University (USA), the University of Trento, and INFN (Italy). The collaboration focuses on performing 3+1 numerical relativity simulations of compact binary spacetimes, supporting the advancing fields of gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy.
