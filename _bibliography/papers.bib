	abstract = {We present the second data release of gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations performed by the Computational Relativity (CoRe) collaboration. The current database consists of 254 different BNS configurations and a total of 590 individual numerical-relativity simulations using various grid resolutions. The released waveform data contain the strain and the Weyl curvature multipoles up to . They span a significant portion of the mass, mass-ratio, spin and eccentricity parameter space and include targeted configurations to the events GW170817 and GW190425. CoRe simulations are performed with 18 different equations of state, seven of which are finite temperature models, and three of which account for non-hadronic degrees of freedom. About half of the released data are computed with high-order hydrodynamics schemes for tens of orbits to merger; the other half is computed with advanced microphysics. We showcase a standard waveform error analysis and discuss the accuracy of the database in terms of faithfulness. We present ready-to-use fitting formulas for equation of state-insensitive relations at merger (e.g. merger frequency), luminosity peak, and post-merger spectrum.},

	abstract = {GW190425 was the second gravitational wave (GW) signal compatible with a binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Since no electromagnetic counterpart was identified, whether the associated kilonova was too dim or the localization area too broad is still an open question. We simulate 28 BNS mergers with the chirp mass of GW190425 and mass ratio 1 ≤ q ≤ 1.67, using numerical-relativity simulations with finite-temperature, composition dependent equations of state (EOS) and neutrino radiation. The energy emitted in GWs is \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.083{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}c{\textasciicircum}2\$ with peak luminosity of 1.1–\$2.4{\textbackslash}times {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}\{58\}/(1+q){\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm \{erg {\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\}\$. Dynamical ejecta and disc mass range between 5 × 10−6–10−3 and 10−5–\$0.1 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, respectively. Asymmetric mergers, especially with stiff EOSs, unbind more matter and form heavier discs compared to equal mass binaries. The angular momentum of the disc is 8–\$10{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textasciitilde}GM\_\{{\textbackslash}rm \{disc\}\}/c\$ over three orders of magnitude in Mdisc. While the nucleosynthesis shows no peculiarity, the simulated kilonovae are relatively dim compared with GW170817. For distances compatible with GW190425, AB magnitudes are always dimmer than ∼20 mag for the B, r, and K bands, with brighter kilonovae associated to more asymmetric binaries and stiffer EOSs. We suggest that, even assuming a good coverage of GW190425’s sky location, the kilonova could hardly have been detected by present wide-field surveys and no firm constraints on the binary parameters or EOS can be argued from the lack of the detection.},

	  abstract={We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We consider nonspinning neutron star binaries over a range of total masses and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems (including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range—0.98 ≲𝑀𝑓/𝑀 ≲0.99 for the mass and 0.85 ≲𝑎𝑓 ≲0.95 for the dimensionless spin—regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart from binary black hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from  <1 to 8, depending on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with reduced tidal deformability 
Λ as small as ∼3.5 can be identified up to a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with Λ∼22 can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron stars from the gravitational wave event GW230529.}

	abstract = {The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to {\textbackslash}emph\{directly\} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10{\textbackslash}\% for binaries at a distance of up to 30{\textasciitilde}Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.},
